## Website

Welcome to the repository of [www.minorversion.com](www.minorversion.com)! I will likely take this private in the future.


## Technical Details

This is a [NextJS](https://nextjs.org) 13 site using the new fancy approuter. I use [typescript](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=typescript&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8) and then just old-school CSS. If I were to make it again I'd use [tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com).

I use [sendgrid](https://sendgrid.com) for emails.

This site is hosted on [vercel](https://vercel.com).

The blog posts are written in [mdx](https://mdxjs.com) and I use [contentlayer](https://www.contentlayer.dev) to parse the mdx to JSON.

Images are AI generated and are all "original".

### Some Cool Stuff

We dynamically fill most of the pages, blog pages are dynamically generated based on mdx articles in /posts/ along with metadata.

We also dynamically fill in the /topics/ pages.

## CSS

Note that much of starting point of [globals.css](/magazine/src/app/globals.css) was taken from [www.increment.com](www.increment.com) as I am no designer! I have since modified it significantly to meet my requirements.
