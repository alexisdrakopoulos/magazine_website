# Syntax

"Syntax refers to the arrangement of words and phrases to create well-formed sentences in a language." - ChatGPT.

Programming languages, usually, have a well defined grammar; a set of reserved keywords, data types, operators, punctuation, scoping rules, etc... In Python 3, this syntax is defined in the [Python Language Reference](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/index.html).

While the grammar of a language gives us a framework with which to produce valid programs, it does not prescribe how to write clean code. Knowing the grammar of a spoken language allows one to form coherent sentences, but does not necessarily make one an eloquent communicator.

## Conventions

No, I don't mean comicon, but rather a set of additional rules that are not enforced by the language, though third party tools often exist to add a layer of enforcement, but are generally accepted by the community. Conventions will be mentioned throughout these articles, as following them is a key part of writing clean code. Conventions allow programmers around the world to write code in a unified manner that extends beyond syntactical rules. This normalization of code reduces the mental barrier to entry when reading foreign code, as a well trained programmers brain knows what to expect.

## Naming

Other than reserved keywords, programmers are left to their own devices when it comes to naming variables, functions, classes, their children, and so on.

In Python, the [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) style guide is the de facto standard for naming conventions. It is a good idea to read through it at least once, and to keep it handy for reference, though we will cover much of what it contains throughout the articles in this series.

For example, here are a few conventions around naming various entities in Python:
| | Convention | Example |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------- |
| **Variables** | lower case separated by `_` | `my_variable` |
| **Constants** | UPPER CASE words separated `_` | `MY_CONSTANT` |
| **Functions & Methods** | lower case words separated `_` | `my_function` |
| **Classes** | CamelCase | `MyClass` |

So one might think, following this set of conventions will lead one to write clean code. Clean code, sadly and luckily for our jobs, can't be generated from a set of rules, it extends far beyond the scope of rules to the realm of art. Though any code that doesn't follow these basic rules likely meant the code isn't clean.

## Variables

In programs, variables are names which refer/point to an object. For example, the following program defines two variables `name:python` and `age:python` which refer to a string and integer respectively:
```python
name = "alexis"
age = 28
```

The thoughtful naming of these variables is a key component of clean code. If the above code just said `x = 28:python` the reader would have no reasonable way of ascertaining that `x` refers to an age. If the code instead said `name_of_the_person_called_alexis = 28:python` thta may be quite specific and clear to the reader, but would add unnecessary complexity!

The art of naming is again the same art of the rest of clean code. What is the minimum (required) complexity to naming a variable such that the context can reasonably be ascertained without slowing down or confusing the reader. The names of variables should tell the reader what they contain in the context they live in. In the above context, it is clear that `age:python` refers to the age of the person who's name is defined of the preceding line.

You may have heard "clean code is self-documenting".
