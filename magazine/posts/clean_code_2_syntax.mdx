In this article, we discuss clean code from a Python syntax perspective, covering topics such as variable naming, comments, control flow and more.

# Syntax

Programming languages, usually, have a well defined grammar; a set of reserved keywords,
data types, operators, punctuation, scoping rules, etc... In Python 3, this syntax
is defined in the [Python Language Reference](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/index.html).

While the grammar of a language gives us a framework with which to produce valid programs, it does not prescribe how to write clean code. Knowing the grammar of a spoken language allows one to form coherent sentences, but does not necessarily make one an eloquent communicator.

## Conventions

No, I don't mean comicon, but rather a set of additional rules that are not enforced by the language, though third party tools often exist to add a layer of enforcement, but are generally accepted by the community. Conventions will be mentioned throughout these articles, as following them is a key part of writing clean code. Conventions allow programmers around the world to write code in a unified manner that extends beyond syntactical rules. This normalization of code reduces the mental barrier to entry when reading foreign code, as a well trained programmers brain knows what to expect.

## Naming

Other than reserved keywords, programmers are left to their own devices when it comes to naming variables, functions, classes, their children, and so on.

In Python, the [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) style guide is the de facto standard for naming conventions. It is a good idea to read through it at least once, and to keep it handy for reference, though we will cover much of what it contains throughout the articles in this series.

For example, here are a few conventions around naming various entities in Python:
| | Convention | Example |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------- |
| **Variables** | lower case separated by `_` | `my_variable` |
| **Constants** | UPPER CASE words separated `_` | `MY_CONSTANT` |
| **Functions & Methods** | lower case words separated `_` | `my_function` |
| **Classes** | CamelCase | `MyClass` |

So one might think, following this set of conventions will lead one to write clean code. Clean code, sadly and luckily for our jobs, can't be generated from a set of rules, it extends far beyond the scope of rules to the realm of art. Though any code that doesn't follow these basic rules likely meant the code isn't clean.

Note that there are many conventions beyond naming, including ones that relate to design, comments, docstring, testing and so on. It is highly recommended to learn and follow conventions.

## Variables

In programs, variables are names which refer/point to an object. For example, the following program defines two variables `name{:python}` and `age{:python}` which refer to a string and integer respectively:

```python
name = "alexis"
age = 28
```

The thoughtful naming of these variables is a key component of clean code. If the above code just said `x = 28{:python}` the reader would have no reasonable way of ascertaining that `x` refers to an age. If the code instead said `name_of_the_person_called_alexis = 28{:python}` thta may be quite specific and clear to the reader, but would add unnecessary complexity!

The art of naming is again the same art of the rest of clean code. What is the minimum (required) complexity to naming a variable such that the context can reasonably be ascertained without slowing down or confusing the reader. The names of variables should tell the reader what they contain in the context they live in. In the above context, it is clear that `age{:python}` refers to the age of the person who's name is defined of the preceding line. Knowing the context and the level of abstraction is an important part of not only naming variables, but of all clean code concepts. We will discuss abstraction in a separate article as it is a large topic that deserves its own treatment.

### Common Naming Mistakes/Anti-Patterns

- Not following conventions: Follow the pep8 conventions or the conventions of the code base you are writing in.
- Acronyms & shortening: Avoid trying to save a few keystrokes by shortening variable names. For example `usr_inp` instead of `user_input`. The exception to this advice is for well known or agreed upon acronyms/placeholders such as `_`, `i`, `num`, `N` and so on.
- Inconsistency: Whatever style of naming you choose, keep it consistent throughout the code base. If the code base is not yours, see if you can figure out what style they use. It doesn't matter if the style is not your preferred one, consistency is key.
- Using reserved keywords: Python has a small set of reserved keywords, avoid using variable names that overwrite them, I quite often see `list`, `dict` or `type` used as variable names, which is a bad idea!
- Datastructures in the name: It is tempting to clarify what the name is storing. For example let's say we have a variable that is storing a list of floats representing velocities. It can be tempting to name this `velocities_list` as it allows the reader to quickly figure out what the variable is storing, so it seems like an easy way to improve code clarity. It is a better idea however to use type hints (discussed further down) if the type of a variable is not clear from the context. The question also arrises, do I care if velocities are stored in a list? or do I only care if they are in a `Sequence` type? Should it therefore be called `velocities_sequence`? Variable names should contain the minimum necessary complexity to convey the context what the variable stores. Specifying that the velocities are in a `list` is not always necessary.

## Comments

At first glance, comments seem like a brilliant idea. We can add them everywhere to make it extremely clear to any reader what our intention was, what the code is doing, what our favorite cats name is and so on. However, comments **can** add unecessary complexity!

## Control Flow

## Type Hints
