# Clean Code, What and Why?

Not to sound like your therapist, but what do you feel when you look at this code?

```python
def f(v):
  s = 0
  for i in range(len(v)):
    s = s + v[i]
  return s
```

or this code?

```python
f = lambda n:pow(2<<n,n+1,(4<<2*n)-(2<<n)-1)%(2<<n)
```

You may feel a little bit of anxiety, or maybe you feel nothing at all. If you feel nothing, then you are probably a psychopath. If you feel anxiety, then you are probably normal.

The code runs though, so why have this response? Code, afterall, has a single job: communicate instructions to an underlying machine and produce a correct result. Well to put it simply, if you are reading this, you are most likely not a machine; but a human. As humans, our interaction with code is significantly more layered and nuanced. Our job is not to run the code we read, but to understand it. The cleanliness of code can be thought of as the complexity involved with understanding it, but we'll discuss this later.

## Why do people care?

If the code successfully executes, why does anyone care how "clean" the code is?

Useful code is very rarely written in a vacuum by a single contributor, to be never again looked upon.
