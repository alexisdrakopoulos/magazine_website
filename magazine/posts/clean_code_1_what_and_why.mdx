# Clean Code, What and Why?

Not to sound like your therapist, but what do you feel when you look at this code?

```python
def f(v):
  s = 0
  for i in range(len(v)):
    s = s + v[i]
  return s
```

or this code?

```python
f = lambda n:pow(2<<n,n+1,(4<<2*n)-(2<<n)-1)%(2<<n)
```

You may feel a little bit of anxiety, or maybe you feel nothing at all. If you feel nothing, then you are probably a psychopath. If you feel anxiety, then you are probably a software engineer.

## Why do people care?

What evokes such a response? Code fundamentally serves to communicate instructions to machines, so if it does so in a correct manner, why do the above snippets make us uncomfortable?

Useful code is rarely written in isolation by an individual contributor, only to be left like a static framed painting. Instead, code often evolves at a pace unforeseen by its original creator, adapting swiftly to ever-shifting requirements and demands.
