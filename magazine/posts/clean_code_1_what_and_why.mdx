Welcome to a series of beginner level articles, though programmers of varying degrees of experience may find them useful, relating to clean code. Note that these articles are my own opinion and experiences, and are meant to serve as a high level introduction to clean code in Python.

By reading this series of articles, you will learn the answers to:

- What do people mean by clean code?
- Why should I care? How does it affect me?
- What does clean code look like in a modern Python context?
- Where can I go to learn more?

We will start by motivating clean code, and discussing at a high level what the problems with dirty code are. We will then start from syntax and work our way up to larger scale design and architecture. We will discuss the tools and techniques that can be used to write clean code, and how to apply them to a modern Python code base.

<NoticeBox notice="What is our definition of clean code?" noticeType="note">
  Note that our definition of clean code relates to complexity. There is no
  agreed upon definition of what constitutes clean code. We are unlikely to
  discuss any controversial topics as we will be focusing on fundamentals. We
  will not be discussing topics such as the merits of functional vs object
  oriented programming, or the merits of static vs dynamic typing. We will be
  discussing topics such as naming, documentation, testing, design and so on.

Let's get started!

# Clean Code & Unecessary Complexity?

Not to sound like your therapist, but what do you feel when you look at this code?

```python
def f(v):
  s = 0
  for i in range(len(v)):
    s = s + v[i]
  return s
```

or this code?

```python
f = lambda n:pow(2<<n,n+1,(4<<2*n)-(2<<n)-1)%(2<<n)
```

You may feel a little bit of anxiety, or maybe you feel nothing at all. If you feel nothing, then you are probably a psychopath. If you feel anxiety, then you are probably a software engineer.

What evokes such a response? Code fundamentally serves to communicate instructions to machines, so if it does so in a correct manner, why do the above snippets make us uncomfortable?

## Malicious Code

Dirty code, such as the snippets above, is malicious. It taxes readers unnecessarily by forcing them to spend time and energy deciphering the writings of a madman. It is a form of torture, and should be treated as such. To put it another way, it has **unecessary complexity**.

Code **complexity** refers to how challenging or convoluted a piece of code is to understand. It relates to the structural and conceptual intricacies present in the code. Complexity is not inherently bad.

**Necessary complexity** can be defined as the minimum required complexity a code must have to still solve the underlying problem for which the code was written. Unnecessary complexity is any complexity beyond this minimum. Note that this concept of necessary complexity goes beyond syntax and includes design, documentation and all aspects related to the user and developer experience.

When you read the first snippet of code:

```python
def f(v):
  s = 0
  for i in range(len(v)):
    s = s + v[i]
  return s
```

you likely took a few seconds, maybe more, to understand what the function `f()` is doing, what the return `s` would be, what types of inputs it can likely accept and so on. You likely then came to the conclusion that `f()` iterates over the elements of `v` and sums them up, assuming that the + operator is doing arithmetic and not something nasty such as concatenation, and returns the sum stored in the variable `s`.

This code, has unecessary complexity! It demanded of us more labour than required. The minimum complexity solution, and therefore the clean code one, would be something like: `sum(velocities)`. We can now even see that `v` was actually some datastructure storing velocity information on which we compute a sum.

Code is clean when it solves an underlying problem using only necessary complexity.

<NoticeBox notice="Clean Code is more than you might think!" noticeType="note">
  To motivate this series of articles, we presented a few short snippets of
  messy code. It is important to realise that larger pieces of code, are not
  equivalent to a series of short pieces of code. Larger pieces of code have
  more complex properties and require thoughtful abstraction and design. These
  are topics we will discuss in later articles.
</NoticeBox>

## Why is Unnecessary Complexity an Issue?

Useful code is rarely a static finished piece of work. Code bases are dynamic beings, evolving to adapt to ever-shifting requirements and demands. Think of a code base more like a city, rather than a single building. In a city, new buildings are constructed, old ones torn down, maintenance is performed and so on. What are the analogous pieces of work that would require one to read code?

### Bug Fixing

Any reasonably large piece of code will have some path of logic which leads to some unexpected consequence, such as an error. As bugs are discovered, contributors will hopefully desire to fix them. Fixing a bug usually requires a good understanding of the underlying programmatic cause. The more complex the code, the more difficult finding the root cause becomes. Clean code helps ensure that bugs can be understood and addressed in a reasonable amount of time.

### Novel or Deprecated Logic

What is demanded and required of a code base is dynamic. Perhaps a new use case appears that requires new logic, maybe the user population itself has shifted and what satisfied the previous users is no longer enough. Whatever the code base, the passage of time will usually lead to the want for new code, and the disuse of other portions of code.

So what would clean code be in this context? We earlier defined clean code as being the minimum required complexity to achieve some goal. This is directly applicatible to the context of adding novel logic or deprecating unwanted code.

We haven't yet discussed abstractions and the structure of programs and their relation to clean code, so what this looks like may not be clear quite yet. In just a few articles things well become clearer.

## Writing Effectively

When writing spoken language, good authors consider context, who the reader likely is, and what they want. Just like any product, writing must deliver enough value to the reader to justify the valuable time and energy spent reading! Readers don't care what thoughts we have, no matter how novel, but rather how these thoughts may change their own.

  I highly recommend this [lecture](https://youtu.be/vtIzMaLkCaM) by Larry
  McEnerney. His discussion on the shortcomings of taught writing and their
  implications to technical writing are highly insightful and relevant to
  programmers.
